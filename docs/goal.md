we want to enhance the animator editor so that we can set animations to entities

so that an npc can idle, walk, run, jump, crouch, etc.

some animations are already present for testing and all the basis for this is already there

what is lacking is for the animator to be able to set animations to entities 

so that we can set animations to entities and edit them, 

to verify , we will add theses animations to the player in the third person mode

make sure we can edit the animations in the animator editor even for the player
