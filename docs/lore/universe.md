# The Universe of Mars (2283 AD)

## 1. The Setting: Post-Apocalyptic Mars
The year is roughly 2283. Mars is no longer the barren red planet it once was, nor is it the utopia humanity dreamed of. It is a terraformed world of red peaks, icy mountains, and green valleys, now littered with the rusting skeletons of a golden age that ended in fire.

### History of the Fall
- **The Divergence**: In the late 20th century, the Space Race never ended. The USSR reached Mars first, followed significantly by the USA. Both superpowers established massive colonies, fueled by a resource-rich Mars and ancient alien technology discovered deep beneath the surface.
- **The Golden Age**: For decades, Mars flourished. Great cities rose. Technology advanced rapidly—bionics, anti-gravity, and fusion energy became commonplace.
- **The Dead Hand**: On Earth, the Cold War turned hot. A "Dead Hand" system triggered a nuclear apocalypse, silencing Earth. On Mars, paranoia took hold. Cut off from home, the colonies accused each other of the strike.
- **The Mars War**: The colonies obliterated each other. Biological weapons, orbital strikes, and tactical nukes shattered the terraformed paradise. The sky turned ash-gray for a century.
- **The Dark Age**: Survivors regressed. Technology became magic. History became myth. In the 200 years since, feudal societies have risen from the ashes, scavenging "Old World" tech they barely understand.

## 2. Metaphysics: Consciousness & Reality
In this universe, **Consciousness** is a fundamental force of nature, like gravity or electromagnetism. It is a field that permeates reality.

### The Aliens ("The Order")
- **Nature**: An ancient species from a distant galaxy that transcended biology to become beings of pure thought/energy. They exist within the fabric of reality itself.
- **Goal**: "The Merging." They believe the ultimate truth of the universe can only be found when all consciousness is unified into a single, perfect entity. They seek to assimilate all sentient life.
- **The False God**: To humans, the Alien Consciousness manifests as a singular, divine entity—often calling itself "God." It speaks to chosen individuals, guiding them to "unify" humanity (a euphemism for preparation for assimilation).
- **Abilities**: They can reorder matter with thought, but struggle to understand emotion or the "chaos" of biological life.

### The Struggler (The MC)
- **Nature**: A unique hybrid. The MC is a human who died and was resurrected by the Aliens, their "void" filled with Alien energy.
- **The Power**: The MC possesses **Determination/Will**, a power that allows them to "forge" their own destiny.
- **The Thread**: The MC can see "The Thread"—a golden path indicating the sequence of events that leads to the Aliens' desired future (The Merging). The player can choose to follow it or sever it.

## 3. Core Themes
- **Order vs. Chaos**: The Aliens represent absolute, stagnant Order. Humanity represents chaotic, painful, but creative Life.
- **Illusion vs. Truth**: The "beauty" of the unified world promised by the Aliens is a sterile lie. The "ugly" struggle of human life is the gritty truth.
- **Contemplation**: A third path. Recognizing the beauty in the chaos. Accepting the world as it is, without needing to control it (Order) or burn it down (Chaos).

## 4. The Loop
Mars has a second moon—a materialization of the Alien "Gate." It functions as a temporal anchor.
- **Resurrection**: The MC cannot truly die. Upon death, their consciousness is pulled back by the Alien gate to a previous point (a "save").
- **Cost**: Each resurrection chips away at their humanity. Scars remain. The soul grows weary. The Aliens use this loop to force the MC to "get it right" (achieve The Merging).
