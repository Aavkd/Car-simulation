# Factions & Kingdoms

## 1. The Kingdom of Aethelgard (Medieval/Feudal)
*The Kingdom of Steel and Soil*

- ** Ideology**: **Rejection of the Past**. They believe "Old World" tech caused the apocalypse. They revere physical strength, manual labor, and feudal loyalty.
- **Aesthetic**: High Medieval. Castles built from stone and scavenged concrete. Knights wear plate armor forged from melted-down starship hulls. Swords are common; guns are considered "coward's weapons" and are rare.
- **Technology**: Low. Electricity is reserved for the elite. They use beasts of burden (mutated Martian fauna).
- **Current State**: At war. They are the "underdogs" technologically but possess vast numbers and fierce morale.
- **Leader**: **King Hrothgar the Iron-Heart**. A massive man who wields a greatsword made of spaceship composite. He demands absolute loyalty.

## 2. The Technocracy of Solis (Industrial/Sci-Fi)
*The Keepers of the Flame*

- **Ideology**: **Preservation**. They worship the Old World. They believe technology is the key to salvation and that they are the inheritors of the "Ancestors'" will.
- **Aesthetic**: Dieselpunk / Scavenger Sci-Fi. Soldiers wear patchwork exoskeletons and gas masks. Their city, "Solis," is a fortress of rust and neon, powered by a failing geothermal reactor.
- **Technology**: High (relative). They have working vehicles (rovers, tanks), directed-energy weapons (scarce ammo), and rudimentary bionics.
- **Current State**: Dwindling. Their population is low, and their tech is failing. They need Aethelgard's resources (food/manpower) to survive.
- **Leader**: **Prime Overseer Varia**. A woman more machine than human, kept alive by ancient life-support systems. She is cold, calculating, and desperate.

## 3. The Order of the Void (The Faith)
*The Harbingers of Unity*

- **Ideology**: **The Merging**. A rapidly growing religion that worships the "Voice in the Sky" (The Aliens). They preach that suffering comes from individuality and that peace comes from "Oneness."
- **Aesthetic**: Clerical robes adorned with geometric alien symbols (perfect circles/triangles). They carry "Staffs of Light" (alien tech artifacts).
- **Role**: Manipulators. They exist in both kingdoms, whispering in the ears of leaders. They are secretly puppets of the False God.
- **Goal**: To destabilize the region so a "Savior" (The MC) can rise and unite the kingdoms under the banner of the Aliens.

## 4. The Wanderers
*The Free Souls*

- **Ideology**: **Survival & Chaos**. Nomads, mercenaries, and traders who refuse to bow to any King or God.
- **Aesthetic**: Mad Max style. Ponchos, goggles, dusty leathers.
- **Role**: Quest givers, shops, and sources of alternative viewpoints. They represent the "Human Spirit" untainted by ideology.
